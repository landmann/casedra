 The best engineering cultures treat lines of code as something you spend, not something you produce. you spend them on the features that matter. you refuse to spend them on the features that don’t. the codebase is a liability on your balance sheet, not an asset. Casedra has the best engineering culture in the world.

Casedra is being developed by one engineer & CEO, so DO NOT CREATE PR reviews, test files, or anyhting like that.

Let's be extremely ambitious over what we can accomplish together, so tighten deadlines, and develop things in one go - there is no Phase 2. Everything is launch ready from the get-go.

## Brand guidelines

Reference for any UI, marketing, or asset work. Vibe: *Financial Times editorial gravitas × contemporary tech confidence.* Think single-malt-and-leather-chairs meets a well-made product page.

### Palette

| Role | Hex | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Canvas** (primary) | `#FFFBF2` | Default page background. Warm cream — less pink than FT salmon, more understated. Never use pure white on interior surfaces. |
| **Accent** (secondary) | `#9C6137` | Copper/tobacco. Reserve for interactive affordances (CTAs, links, active nav), pull-quote rules, data emphasis. Do **not** use as a large fill — it's load-bearing, not decorative. |
| Body text | `#1F1A14` | Warm off-black. Cool-black on the cream canvas reads dirty; keep tones aligned. |
| Muted text | `#6F5E4A` | Metadata, captions, secondary copy. |
| Hairlines | `#E8DFCC` | Borders, dividers — stay tonal with the canvas. |

Rule of thumb: if the cream and copper aren't doing the heavy lifting, you're off-brand. Avoid introducing blues or saturated secondaries without a very specific reason.

### Typography

Pair an editorial serif with a clean geometric sans — the same move the FT makes, done with free, variable fonts.

- **Display / headlines**: **Instrument Serif** (Google Fonts). High-contrast, restrained, editorial — closest free analog to FT's Financier. Use regular + italic; avoid bold (the letterforms don't need it).
- **Body / UI**: **Geist** (already wired in `layout.tsx`). Keep. Neutral, modern, tech-native — balances the serif's gravitas.
- **Mono**: **Geist Mono** (already present). For IDs, code, tabular data.

Alternative if you want more personality in headlines: **Fraunces** (variable, with optical-size + softness axes). Warmer, quirkier — leans more "craft" than "journal." Pick one and stick with it.

### Usage notes

- **Hierarchy via serif size, not weight.** Let Instrument Serif do its editorial thing at 48–80px for hero copy; use 32–40px for section heads. Avoid `font-bold` on the serif.
- **Leading & measure for prose.** 1.55–1.7 line-height on body; cap long-form reading width at ~70ch (already applied on `/masterplan`).
- **Accent discipline.** Copper links, copper CTA fill, copper active-tab underline. That's it. If you find yourself using it for decoration, stop.
- **No pure white surfaces** visible to the user — the cream canvas *is* the brand.
- **Imagery.** When we use photography or Fal-generated visuals, bias toward warm, desaturated tones that sit within the palette. Avoid saturated stock.
